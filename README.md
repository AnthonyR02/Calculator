# Calculator
This program asks the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, or /) and two numbers. It then performs the appropriate operation using a switch statement and displays the result. Note that this program does not handle invalid input (e.g. non-numeric input), so you may want to add additional input validation if you plan to use it in a real-world application.
